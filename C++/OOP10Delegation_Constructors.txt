Delegating Constructors
Often the code for constructors is very similar
Duplicated Code can lead to errors

C++ Allows Delegating Constructors
- code for one constructor can call another in the initialization list
- avoids duplicating code

Overloading Constructor then...

Player :: Player (std::string name_val, int health_val, int xp_val)
    : name{name_val}, health{health_val}, xp{xp_val} {}

Player :: Player()
    : Player{"None", 0, 0} {}

Player :: Player(std::string name_val)
    : Player {name_val, 0, 0} {}

Only works on initialization list.
cannot call other constructors from the body in the delegation constructors.
