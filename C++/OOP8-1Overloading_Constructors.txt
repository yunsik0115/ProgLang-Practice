Overloading Constructors
Classes can have as many constructors as necessary
Each must have a unique signature
Default constructor is no longer compiler generated once another constructor is declared.

Overloaded constructors
Provides Powerful way to initialize in various way

class Player{
    private:
        std::string name;
        int health;
        int xp;
    public:
        // Overloaded Constructors
        Player();
        Player(std::string name_val);
        Player(std::string name_val, int health_val, int xp_val);
    };

Player::Player() {
    name = "None";
    health = 0;
    xp = 0;
}

Player :: Player(std::string name_val) {
    name = name_val;
    health = 0;
    xp = 0;
}

Player :: Player(std :: string name_val, int health_val, int xp_val) {
    name = name_val;
    health = health_val;
    xp = xp_val;
}
