When Objects are copied C++ must create a new object from existing object

When is a copy of an object made?
1) passing object by value as parameter
2) returning an objecvt from a function by value
3) constructing one object based on another of the same class

C++ must have a way of accomplishing this so it provides a compiler-defined copy constructor if you don't
